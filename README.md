An end-to-end Power BI project analyzing the complete business performance of an e-commerce company — covering marketing ROI, customer value, retention, logistics, inventory, product performance, and returns.  
Developed as part of the **Continuous Evaluation #2 Business Intelligence Project**, this dashboard delivers actionable insights that connect revenue growth with underlying profitability challenges.

## 🌍 Situation  
The e-commerce company faced **stagnant profit growth despite increasing revenue**.  
The management lacked a unified analytical view to understand which functions — marketing, operations, or customer engagement — were driving or hurting profitability.

- Analyze **7 functional datasets** and clean them for analysis.  
- Build a **multi-page Power BI dashboard** following a clear business storytelling flow.  
- Create **custom DAX measures** to uncover revenue, retention, and cost insights.  
- Identify root causes of profit stagnation and propose data-driven improvement opportunities.

- Created **60+ custom DAX measures** including ROAS, CLV, Retention Rate, Inventory Turnover, Margin Leakage, and Refund Ratio.  
- Applied a **3-tier KPI storytelling framework** — North Star (L1), Drivers (L2), and Diagnostics (L3).  
- Designed intuitive visuals using **cards, bar charts, scatter plots, and bubble charts** with consistent color themes and slicers.  
- Focused each dashboard on business questions like *“Why profit stagnated?”* and *“Where is value leaking?”*
